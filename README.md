# HandleChildBrowser

### HandleChildBrowser

This Java class demonstrates handling multiple browser windows (child windows) using Selenium in a web automation framework:

- **Description**:
  - **Web Browser**: Utilizes ChromeDriver to automate interactions with the Chrome browser.
  - **Target Website**: `https://www.irctc.co.in/nget/train-search`
  - **Child Windows Handling**: Opens and switches between multiple browser windows (child windows) generated by clicking on various links (Buses, Flights, Hotels) within the main window.
  - **Waits and Conditions**: Implements explicit waits (`WebDriverWait`) to ensure elements are clickable before performing actions.
  - **Window Management**: Collects all window handles, switches between them, prints the title and URL of each window, and switches back to the main window when necessary.

- **Core Methods**:
  - **WebDriverWait**: `wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath("...")));` - Waits for the elements to be clickable before performing click actions.
  - **Click Actions**: Clicks on the Buses, Flights, and Hotels links to open new windows.
  - **Handle Windows**: `Set<String> windowHandles = driver.getWindowHandles();` and `driver.switchTo().window(windowHandle);` - Manages multiple window handles for switching between different browser windows.
  - **Print Window Details**: Prints the title, URL, and handle of each window for verification.
  - **Switch Main Window**: `driver.switchTo().window(windowList.get(0));` - Switches back to the main window and prints its title for confirmation.
